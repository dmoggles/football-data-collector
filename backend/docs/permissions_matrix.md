# Permissions Matrix

This document defines backend authorization expectations for current roles and scopes.

## Role Definitions

- `anonymous`: no authenticated session.
- `authenticated`: logged-in user with no required elevated role.
- `team_member`: user has any membership on a given team.
- `team_admin`: user has `team_admin` membership on a given team.
- `super_admin`: platform-level global role (`global_roles.role = super_admin`).

## Notes

- `super_admin` remains platform-scoped and is audited for privileged changes.
- Team-scoped checks are enforced through centralized permission helpers in `app/api/permissions.py`.
- Coach and parent capabilities are intentionally excluded for now and will be added when their feature set is defined.
